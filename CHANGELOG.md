# tenjin-cli

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- 86013ef: Rename `tenjin lookup` to `tenjin search`, following the unified search API in
  BackTrackCo/tenjin#463. The command, the MCP tool (`tenjin_search`), the outcome
  flag (`--search-id`), the candidate flag (`--search-id`), the response field
  (`searchId`), the attribution header (`X-Tenjin-Search-Id`), the error code
  (`SEARCH_NOT_FOUND`), and the local store all move together; `tenjin lookup` is
  gone rather than aliased, so a stale invocation fails loudly instead of drifting.

  A `MISS` can now carry a `browse` tail: at most three unscored pointers
  (`resourceId`, `url`, `title`, `price`, `creator.handle`) into the broad
  discoverable corpus, rendered as one human hint line with each pointer's price
  in dollars (the `--json` envelope keeps the exact atomic value) and kept out of
  `candidates` and out of the local store.

- ac703f9: `tenjin install` now leaves behind a retrieval-instinct nudge, not just a pointer
  to where the skills live. The one line it keeps in AGENTS.md (Codex/shared) tells
  the agent to run `tenjin search "<question>" --json` before regenerating public
  research (version-specific compatibility, integration gotchas, benchmarks, dated
  probes), and is honest that the search, while free and anonymous, sends the
  generalized question text to tenjin.blog. Re-running install upgrades an older line
  in place instead of skipping it or appending a duplicate, and the walkthrough
  discloses what the nudge does plus how to undo it (delete the marker line).

  Claude Code gets the same nudge, opt-in, in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`: install asks at
  an interactive terminal (disclosing that question text is sent to tenjin.blog), or
  writes it non-interactively only when you pass `--claude-md` (`--no-claude-md`
  suppresses the question). `--dry-run` prints what would change and writes nothing.

- e607207: The CLI is now human-first at a terminal. At an interactive terminal without
  `--json`, every command prints a plain human rendering to stdout and no JSON;
  with `--json`, or when the output is piped (an agent, a script), it prints exactly
  one JSON envelope and nothing else. Exit codes are unchanged. Agents should pass
  `--json`; the bundled skills now do so on every command.

  `tenjin install` becomes a real onboarding walkthrough: skills installed per
  harness, a publish-mode question, optional wallet creation with the address and
  funding steps, and a one-line health check, instead of a JSON blob. Pass `--json`
  (or pipe it) for the machine envelope, and `--no-wallet` to skip the wallet step.

- 57f3131: Add `tenjin mcp`, a local stdio MCP server over the existing command cores. It
  exposes seven tools (`tenjin_search`, `tenjin_inspect`, `tenjin_buy`,
  `tenjin_outcome`, `tenjin_publish`, `tenjin_candidate`, `tenjin_wallet`) that call
  `search` / `inspect` / `buy` / `outcome` / `publish` / `candidate` / `wallet`
  in-process, returning each command's machine JSON envelope as `structuredContent`
  with a short text summary. The consent semantics are the CLI's, unchanged: the
  spend policy gates buying, `publish.mode` gates publishing (an MCP client renders
  the `needs_confirmation` payload as its own confirm UI, then re-calls with
  `yes:true`), and hard content blocks are never bypassable. The wallet stays local
  and its key never leaves the machine. Register it with
  `claude mcp add tenjin -s user -- tenjin mcp`.

### Patch Changes

- cf5b750: Align the vendored skills with hybrid retrieval. `tenjin-search` now says lookup
  matches wording and meaning and to send the whole question as one
  natural-language sentence instead of compressing it to keywords, and its
  candidate-parking example passes `--question` so the searcher's phrasing becomes
  a `questionsAnswered` entry on the published card. `tenjin-publish` spells out
  how to phrase that card: 5 to 10 `questionsAnswered` entries of at most 200
  characters, varied in register, `tasksSupported` kept to tasks, and a dense
  factual `scope` because scope is searched too. The README lookup guidance
  matches.
- fcba417: Resync the vendored zero-install skill from live tenjin.blog/skills.md: search
  endpoint rename (`searchId`, `browse` tail, searches outcomes path) and
  hybrid-retrieval guidance (matching on wording and meaning, whole-question
  phrasing, answer-card rules).

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Minor Changes

- 686c613: `publish.mode` now governs all publishing uniformly: a piece you asked for and a
  reusable answer your agent derives after a lookup both go through the same consent
  mode. The default is now **review**: every publish surfaces a one-click yes/no
  before anything leaves your machine, even on a clean scan. Set `auto` to publish
  clean scans automatically (`tenjin config set publish.mode auto`), or `full-auto`
  to stop only on detected secrets.

  `tenjin lookup` now nudges once on stderr when you have parked candidate drafts
  (and how many are stale over 7 days), so reusable answers you set aside resurface
  instead of rotting.

  Migration: an unconfigured setup that relied on promptless clean-scan publishing
  must now run `tenjin config set publish.mode auto` (or pass `--mode auto` /
  `--yes` per publish) to keep publishing without the per-publish confirm.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- b08323e: Publish from the CLI. `tenjin publish <file.md>` ships a Markdown piece with an
  optional answer card (question/task/scope/exclusions/applies-to and more, from
  frontmatter or flags), gated by a deterministic local scan that hard-blocks
  secrets and surfaces PII, wallet addresses, and long verbatim quotes for review.
  A `publish.mode` consent cascade (`review` / `auto` / `full-auto`, with a
  loosening gate on committed project config) governs whether a publish asks first,
  and `tenjin install` can set the mode once during setup. Writes are signed with an
  RFC 9421 P-256 session key delegated by a single wallet signature, so a returning
  publisher never re-signs until it expires.

  Park and publish drafts locally: `tenjin candidate add/list/drop` stores drafts
  that never upload on their own, and `tenjin publish --candidate <id>` publishes a
  parked candidate through the same scan and consent flow, clearing it on success.

  New config keys `publish.mode` and `publish.defaultPrice` (settable via
  `tenjin config set` or a per-project `.tenjin.json`) control the default consent
  mode and price.
