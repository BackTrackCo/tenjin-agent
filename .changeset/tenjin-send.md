`tenjin send <amount> <token> <to>`: an explicit escape hatch to move USDC on Base out of the agent wallet. Previews the resolved (checksummed) recipient, exact amount, and worst-case network fee, requires an interactive confirm or `--yes` before anything is signed, refuses when the active wallet's passphrase entry is missing, waits for the receipt, and prints the tx hash (a revert or missing receipt fails as SEND_FAILED, exit 4). A new `sendMaxAmount` config key adds a hard per-send cap that `--yes` can never bypass (`0` disables the verb; default `none`). Known fund-destroying recipients (the token contract, the zero and burn addresses, the wallet itself) refuse outright, and RPC gas/fee estimates are bounded by sane Base ceilings. Signs through the same TenjinSigner/WalletProvider seam as `buy` (the seam gains `signTransaction`); deliberately excluded from the MCP toolset and the skill adapters, both pinned by tests.
